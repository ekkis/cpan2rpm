  to Christophe Beauregard (chris.beauregard@ec.gc.ca>from Canada for providing
  this one-liner
- More general fetch method validator.
- Allow cached URLs detected from CPAN to still auto-sniff out the author information
  from the URL.  Ex: cpan2rpm Class::AccessorOB

  Bill Williams for reporting this.

2.027 02/07/05 09:17:44
- added error handling to untar()s system call.  Thanks to Paolo
  Campanella <paolo@mighty.co.za> for submitting the patch
- fixed problems in untar() with Windows zip file listings
- applied patch from Tanner Lovelace <clubjuggler@gmail.com> to fix
  problems with Mandrake builds having to do with document compression
- another patch we owe to Garrick, this one strips out a = from --doc
  when present
- fixes to prologue and epilogue whereby ||s were forcing scalar context
- fixed typo
- thanks to Garrick Staples <garrick@usc.edu> for providing the patch
- this patch cleans up the POD text scribbled on spec files.  Thanks
  to Garrick Staples <garrick@usc.edu> for providing the patch.
- two small changes.  The first simply puts single quotes around
  arguments with spaces in the comment at the top of the generated spec file.
  The second prevents the addition of the buildarch: tag if --spec-only
  was used, and --buildarch wasn't specified; this generates a more
  portable spec file.
  Thanks to Garrick Staples <garrick@usc.edu> for providing the patch.
- fixed archive listing for Windows zip files.  Thanks to Daniel
  J. McDonald <dan.mcdonanld@austinenergy.com> for the code.
- patched untar() to properly deal with tarballs that don't contain
  directory entries (e.g. Image::Base)
- renamed internal keys for cpanplus/cpan
- added support notation for RHELv3 (thanks to Matt Allen
  <mallen@theebizshop.net> for his note on compatibility)
- fixes for various tarball listing issues
- changed fetch default to C<web> and permissible values of --fetch parameter
- no longer attempts CPAN+, CPAN but uses passed value
- fixed handling of aggregate values passed to --no-requires which was
  broken.  Thanks to Joshua Daniel Franklin [joshuadf@u.washington.edu]
  for pointing this out.

2.026 03/14/04 15:17:23
- yikes! I broke the upgrade() function in having changed the
  interface for inst_rpm() - this patch fixes that.  Thanks to
  Rainer Lay for pointing this out

2.025 03/13/04 14:14:37
- implemented CPAN+ support
- renamed --cpan to --fetch to specify fetch methods
- now supports building directories other than the current
- tarballs created with older versions of tar do not include the embedded
  subdirectory as a single line.  applied patch to fix this problem.
  Thanks to Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@dev.InTechnology.co.uk>
  for pointing this out
- packages that include perl scripts may contain any number of paths
  for the perl executable in the first line (#!).  This causes the
  requirements generator to product reqs for the various paths of
  perl, which is a problem.  this fix patches all perl scripts
  so they generate a single req for the correct perl path.  for
  an example see the Tk package which lists both /usr/bin/perl and
  /usr/local/bin/perl - thanks to Adam Shand [ashand@wetafx.co.nz]
  for pointing this out.
- distributions containing multiple modules each of which has a makefile
  generated leave the metadata hash populated with the last module
  processed instead of the first (which is usually the parent package).
  This behaviour causes a problem whereby a module like Tk ends up
  renamed as Tk::Text - thanks to Adam Shand [ashand@wetafx.co.nz] for
  pointing this out

2.024 02/25/04 20:08:34

  Thanks to ratness for pointing this out.
- applied sourceforge patch reported as bug #871766 having to do with
  whitespace returned in calls to RPM for directory structure
- applied sourceforge patch #890063 - thanks to Stephen for a better approach

  tags found only in the spec file e.g. %_sourcedir %{_topdir}/%{name}-%{version}.
  Thanks to Ian Burrell for fingering this.
- fixed broken --name which got overwritten by calculated value.  Thanks Ian!
- Make sure the fake Makefile.PL is within the same directory as the old one.

- Changed to use both PREFIX and DESTDIR.
- Works with ExtUtils::MakeMaker < 5.91 and > 6.05
  (Requires an upgrade for those versions in between.)
- Add instructions on how to upgrade MakeMaker to README.
- Our gratitude to Michal Jaegermann for pointing out and helping improve
and fix the following issues:
    - Changed the cpan2rpm rpm itself to be "noarch".
    - Convert all system() calls from "single scalar" mode.
    - Remove "Distribution:" from spec unless specified.
    - Adjusted %files section to prevent the package from owning the
      upper directories to reduce paranoia.
    - Use File::Temp::tempdir instead of hard coded "/tmp/cpan2rpm" for
      easier clean up and for security reasons.
    - Replaced all getrpm_* functions with a shell call to rpm.
      Now works with multi-line macros.
    - The --spec-only sends contents to --spec setting instead of STDOUT.
      This fixes a problem with modules that write to stdout for configuration
      purposes which previously included that output in the spec file.

whilst attempting to build Apache::SOAP:
    - added support for PKZip archives and .bz2s
    - now cleans up ctrl-Ms from Windoze-based distributions
- More general --buildarch default setting.

package building.  This replaces the previous hack which used the ~/redhat
directory.

%files section
- reorganised POD to break options into logical groups
- now creates a more generic spec file

2.008  2002/12/18 23:00:00

NAME in the call to MakeMaker(), resulting in an unwriteable filename
which included a given url.  Thanks to Rainer Lay for pointing this out.
the script broke building the C<Class-MethodMaker> package.
- changed all references to $RPM_BUILD_ROOT to the more flexible %{buildroot}
- style change in opening files from open(F, $f) to open(_)

2.003  2002/11/26 18:19:13
- Safer to pipe stderr to /dev/null than to hope
  that the rmdir on the local platform supports
  the --ignore-fail-on-non-empty flag.

2.002  2002/11/25 21:18:48  ekkis
- minor modification to pick up the DISTNAME, from the call to

Revision 1.52  2002/09/19 03:37:21  ekkis
- added no-localcopy functionality to make local copies of output files
- made %setup section more generic
- patched use of HTTP::Lite
- rearranged POD to have Author on a single line and added acknowledgements and license info

Revision 1.51  2002/09/13 21:48:34  bbb
Only use one line of the AUTHOR perldoc section to avoid breaking rpm spec syntax.

Revision 1.50  2002/06/28 01:22:41  ekkis
- our thanks to Jim Radford <radford@robotics.caltech.edu> for all the suggestions and patches resulting in this batch of changes
- added --patch, --make and --make-install for greater flexibility
- fixed regexp generating %doc list.  code now picks up documentation in subdirectories
- modified use of HTTP::Lite to make optional.  cpan2rpm now works without it (minus capability to fetch urls)
- README file now shows how to boot-strap HTTP::Lite

Revision 1.49  2002/06/03 14:17:11  bbb
Add username to buildroot to avoid multi-user machine conflicts.

Revision 1.48  2002/06/01 01:07:38  ekkis
minor POD change

Revision 1.47  2002/06/01 01:04:24  ekkis
- now uses the POD's Synopsis section for the RPM Description tag.  This is the way it should be since POD Descriptions typically contain large amounts of text.
- Rewrote Synopsis and Description sections of the POD

Revision 1.46  2002/05/31 23:59:33  ekkis
- changed shebang line to make MakeMaker happy (thx Hook BOT)

Revision 1.45  2002/05/31 23:35:40  ekkis
- redesigned the %files section (at the suggestion of Eric Kolve [ekolve@corp.classmates.com]) to fix problems with modules that contain XS e.g. DBI
- added a smart %doc section which picks up documentation from the tarball (with help from Hook-BOT (Bob Brown <bbb@cpan.org>) for file regexp)
- now uses %{_prefix} to list files which is better than /usr since it allows redefinition e.g. _prefix=/usr/local (Hook-BOT)
- trimmed descriptions and reformatted ad banner
- improved %clean section with code that wipes the extracted source tree structure after building (which can bloat disk badly when doing a lot of rpms) - thx Hook-BOT!
- fixed --spec-only (thx Eric Kolve)

Revision 1.44  2002/05/29 16:32:10  bbb
~/.rpmmacros

Revision 1.43  2002/05/28 23:32:29  ekkis
changed e-mail addresses

Revision 1.42  2002/05/28 23:13:28  bbb
Same as second round "1.3" but in the right place now.

Revision 1.5  2002/05/23 02:55:37  ekkis
adding "use strict" forces Makefile.PL to be eval()uated that way so had to add "no strict" to eval string.  Also added warning in case eval fails.

Revision 1.4  2002/05/23 02:43:43  ekkis
added use strict

Revision 1.3  2002/05/23 02:14:04  ekkis
oops, small patch

Revision 1.2  2002/05/23 02:13:07  ekkis
added --nopkgprfx in case we want to build RPMs without a prepended "perl-" (as in the case of cpan2rpm<g>)

Revision 1.1  2002/05/22 23:47:59  ekkis
Moved from dist to .

Revision 1.40  2002/05/22 23:03:35  ekkis
since we're no longer including the package version number in the spec filename when building multiple versions of the same package we're force to --force.  this makes no sense to the script will now _always_ build the spec file

Revision 1.39  2002/05/19 01:04:44  ekkis
still haveing problem with DBI - couldn't figure out how to eval() Makefile.PL so assuming pkgname from module (or passed)

Revision 1.38  2002/05/18 22:55:00  ekkis
- patched to allow calls like "use ExtUtils::MakeMaker qw(WriteMakefile)"... note this currently only works with () and will fail with qw//.  Due to DBI calls.
- also changed MyExit() to die() instead since we really do need for the script to exit but without exiting us!
- patched to allow for calls like  ExtUtils::MakeMaker::WriteMakefile() as found in DBD::mysql

Revision 1.37  2002/05/07 04:21:49  ekkis
added --make-maker parameter

Revision 1.36  2002/04/23 00:29:24  ekkis
- implemented protection of my variables from Makefile.PL being eval()d by surrounding that code with a package.  Considered the Safe module but decided against another dependency.

Revision 1.35  2002/04/22 23:19:13  ekkis
--provides and --requires weren't working

Revision 1.34  2002/04/18 08:32:53  ekkis
- put back code to generate name/e-mail addr of packager (uses hostname())
- added END {} code to make sure we clean up.  $SIG{__DIE__} works only for die() calls
- now picks up AUTHOR from tarball POD when possible
- modified version parsing code to allow versions with alpha
- redesigned tarls().  now context sensitive, much better way to determine embedded directory
- writefile() now checks for existence

Revision 1.33  2002/04/17 08:52:43  ekkis
- some bug fixes
- {force} implementation for get_url()

Revision 1.32  2002/04/17 08:40:50  ekkis
- added --no-requires, --find-provides, --find-requires and --install options
- now can receive a URL to download from
- reimplemented MyExit for eval()ing Makefile.PL
- enhancements to writefile()

Revision 1.31  2002/04/16 04:06:53  ekkis
ripped out all dependency (provides,requires) generation code as the newer rpm-buid generates this correctly

Revision 1.30  2002/04/12 17:22:35  ekkis
- filelist is now abstracted
- cool new method for extracting CVS version without breaking emacs
- new regexp for splitting path/filename from given $info{module}

Revision 1.29  2002/04/09 23:00:16  ekkis
took out %define version and release as it causes recursive behaviour

Revision 1.28  2002/04/09 22:20:41  ekkis
- better relative path handling
- now prepends url to Source: field when available via CPAN
- BuildRoot more automated now

Revision 1.27  2002/04/09 08:25:00  ekkis
- now requires version 0.59 or greater of CPAN as previous versions are problema tic
- implemented use of RPM macros to figure outdirectory structures.  script now p arses the various macro definition files and does recursive expansions to figure out correct values... see docs.
- added support for a full-path tarball specification.  this allows the user to call cpan2rpm with any tarball anywhere.  The tarball will be copied to SOURCES.
- defined %version, %release
- added Rob Brown's perlver %defines
- BuildRoot now defaults to the standard %{_tmpdir}
- removed version number from spec filename
- now scans only usr/lib in tmpdir for modules (should give better Provides headers since we don't pick up .pm files in other directories like examples/)
- added code to figure out real module dependencies (PREREQ_PM is unreliable)
- now attempts to read VERSION_FROM if neither ABSTRACT nor ABSTRACT_FROM is provided.  failing that it will take the module name (minus any parent info, plus appropriate extension e.g. Ping.pm from Net::Ping), and if that file exists will scan it for POD

Revision 1.26  2002/04/08 22:30:35  ekkis
now requires CPAN version 0.59 as previous versions seem broken
added to TODO list

Revision 1.25  2002/04/07 09:18:19  ekkis
hijacked exit() for the Makefile.PL eval since certain modules exit on us (not very exciting) e.g. POE

Revision 1.24  2002/04/07 02:31:00  ekkis
fixed generation of dependencies on Perl core modules (not allowed)

Revision 1.23  2002/04/07 01:15:33  ekkis
removed dashed lines from CHANGES section... don't konw thy CVS does use this in keyword expansion!

Revision 1.22  2002/04/07 01:12:24  ekkis
